## Hey there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ’¡ I'm a self-taught developer that decided to take a part-time hobby and turn it into a full-time job!
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science
- ğŸŒ± Always available to help with open-source code and ideas that need refining
- ğŸ“« You can reach me through my email: contact@mrtomato.dev

Most of my public repos are old, I mostly help my friends with their projects in private repositories and organizations.

Contact me if you have any questions!
